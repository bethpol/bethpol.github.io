I am a first-year Ph.D. student in EECS at UC Berkeley. My research interests include:

- Data Compression & Rate-Distortion Theory
- Information Theory
- Image/Video Coding
- Watermarking for generative models
- Efficient learning algorithms that leverage coding/communications techniques

I obtained my B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2025.
