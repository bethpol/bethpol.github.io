I am a first-year Ph.D. student in EECS at UC Berkeley. With a background in information theory 
and signal processing, my current research focuses on theory-driven methods for generative models. 
I am especially interested in neural data compression, diffusion models, watermarking, and explainable AI.

I obtained my B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2025.

Two fun facts about me:

1. I am a musician! I played for two seasons as principal harpist with Cornell Orchestras and am currently learning piano for fun.
2. I am a general-class amateur radio operator (callsign: KE2ASU).
