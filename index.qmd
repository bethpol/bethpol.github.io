I am an incoming Ph.D. student in EECS at UC Berkeley and a recent graduate of Cornell University with a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering.

My research interests lie in information theory and signal processing. At Cornell, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Aaron Wagner, where I contributed to the development of algorithms for channel simulation, form of lossy compression with applications in multimedia and model compression. At Berkeley, I will continue to pursue these interests as a member of [BLISS](https://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/).


## Updates

**May 2025**  
I graduated from Cornell University Summa Cum Laude with a B.S. in ECE and as the recipient of the [Sibley Prize](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/ece/major/undergraduate-awards/#:~:text=Sibley%20Prize,average%20over%20all%20four%20years) from the School of ECE. I was also honored as a [Merrill Presidential Scholar](https://scl.cornell.edu/about-scl/awards-funding/merrill-presidential-scholars-program).
