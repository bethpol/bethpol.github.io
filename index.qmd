I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Currently, I am a senior studying Electrical & Computer Engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. My research interests include information theory, signal processing, and machine learning. To see what I have worked on as an undergraduate, please see the Projects page.

Outside of my research, I enjoy playing the harp and reading.
