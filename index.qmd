I am a senior studying Electrical & Computer Engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. My research interests include information theory, data compression, and machine learning. I am pursing doctoral programs with an intended start date of Fall 2025.

Outside of my research, I enjoy playing the harp and reading.
