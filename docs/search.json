With a background in information theory and signal processing, my current research focuses on theory-driven methods for generative models. I am especially interested in neural data compression, diffusion models, watermarking, and explainable AI.\nI obtained my B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2025.\nTwo fun facts about me:\n\nI am a musician! I played for two seasons as principal harpist with Cornell Orchestras and am currently learning piano for fun.\nI am a general-class amateur radio operator (callsign: KE2ASU)."
